      "description":"iPhone 6 is perfect in every way. Large, yet dramatically thin. Powerful, but remarkably power efficient. With a smooth metal surface that seamlessly meets the Retina HD display. It’s one continuous form where hardware and software function in perfect unison. Developing an iPhone with a larger, more advanced display meant pushing the edge of design. From the seamless transition of glass and metal to the streamlined profile, every detail was carefully considered to enhance your experience. So while its display is larger, iPhone 6 feels just right. It's one thing to make a bigger display. It's something else entirely to make a bigger multitouch display with brilliant colors and higher contrast at even wider viewing angles. But that's exactly about the Retina HD display. Built on 64-bit desktop-class architecture, the A8 chip delivers more power, even while driving a larger display. The M8 motion coprocessor efficiently gathers data from advanced sensors and a barometer. And with increased battery life, iPhone 6 lets you do more, for longer than ever. More people take more photos with iPhone than with any other camera. And now the iSight camera has a sensor with Focus Pixels and amazing video features, like 1080p HD at 60 fps, slo-mo at 240 fps, and time-lapse video mode. So you'll have more reasons to capture more moments on video, too. iPhone 6 has faster LTE download speeds, and it supports more LTE bands than any other smartphone so you can roam in more places. And when connected to Wi-Fi, you'll get up to 3x faster speeds. The breakthrough Touch ID technology lets you securely access your iPhone with the perfect password: your fingerprint.",

      "description":"While everyone else was busy trying to keep up with iPhone, Apple were busy creating amazing new features that make iPhone more powerful, easier to use, and more indispensable than ever. The result is iPhone 4. The biggest thing to happen to iPhone since iPhone. All the breakthrough technology in iPhone 4 is situated between two glossy panels of aluminosilicate glass - the same type of glass used in the windshields of helicopters and high-speed trains. Chemically strengthened to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic, the glass is ultradurable and more scratch resistant than ever. It's also recyclable. The 960-by-640 backlit LCD display boasts a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch, making it the highest-resolution phone screen ever. To achieve this, Apple engineers developed pixels so small - a mere 78 micrometers across - that the human eye can't distinguish individual pixels. That makes text remarkably sharp and graphics incredibly vivid. IPS technology also provides excellent color and contrast from almost any viewing angle. Created from Apple's own alloy, then forged to be five times stronger than standard steel, the CNC-machined band is the mounting point for all the components of iPhone 4. The band provides impressive structural rigidity and allows for its incredibly thin, refined design. It also functions as both iPhone 4 antennas. Apple engineers designed the A4 chip to be a remarkably powerful yet remarkably power-efficient mobile processor. With it, iPhone 4 can easily perform complex jobs such as multitasking, editing video, and placing FaceTime calls. All while maximizing battery life. iPhone 4 includes a built-in three-axis gyroscope. When paired with the accelerometer, it makes iPhone 4 capable of advanced motion sensing such as user acceleration, full 3D attitude, and rotation rate. Translation: More motion gestures and greater precision for an even better gaming experience. The iPhone 4 camera shoots gorgeous 5-megapixel photos and stunning HD video. And with its advanced backside illumination sensor, it captures beautiful images even in low-light settings. The built-in LED flash does double duty. When you're taking pictures, it works as a flash. When you're shooting video it can stay on to light up the scene. And on the front of iPhone 4, the built-in camera is perfect for making FaceTime calls and shooting self-portraits. While most phones have only one microphone, iPhone 4 has two. The main mic, located on the bottom next to the dock connector, is for phone calls, voice commands, and memos. The second mic, built into the top near the headphone jack, is for FaceTime calls and for making your phone calls better. It works with the main mic to suppress unwanted and distracting background sounds, such as music and loud conversations. This dual-mic noise suppression helps make every conversation a quiet one. With its large Multi-Touch display and innovative software, iPhone lets you control everything using just your fingers. How does it work? A panel laminated on the glass senses your touch using electrical fields. It can register multiple touches at once to support advanced gestures such as pinch to zoom, two-finger tap, and more. The panel then transmits the information to the Retina display below it.",
