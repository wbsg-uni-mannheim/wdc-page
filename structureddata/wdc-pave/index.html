        <h2>1 Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            Extracting attribute-value pairs from product titles plays a vital role in applications such as demand prediction, recommendation engines, and analyzing product success, which depend on well-structured data. Despite product titles and descriptions being rich in detail, the scarcity and limitations of structured product data can hinder the effectiveness of these applications. 
            Consequently, numerous scholars have endeavored to develop models for extracting product information that can identify informative attribute-value pairs from titles and descriptions. 
            The trend in research is, as in many other domains, shifting from employing pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT towards leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT for instruction. Large Language Models (LLMs) stand out because they minimally require, if any, extensive amounts of labeled training data and possess the ability to generalize across attribute-value pairs not seen during training.
            However, the availability of reliable gold standards for evaluating these approaches is scarce. The WDC-PAVE dataset tries to address this challenge by providing a heterogenous collection of 1420 product titles and descriptions from the <a href="https://webdatacommons.org/largescaleproductcorpus/index.html" target="_blank">WDC Product Matching Corpus</a>, 
            meticulously annotated in accordance with stringent guidelines to guarantee the highest level of data consistency. By making the WDC-PAVE dataset publicly available, we aim to contribute to ongoing research in product attribute-value extraction using LLMs. Our results from various zero- and few-shot experiments with GPT-3.5 demonstrate that the dataset exhibits high reliability, showcasing its potential to serve as a benchmark for this task.

        <section id="wdc">
            <h3>2.1 Web Data Commons Large-Scale Product Matching Data</h3>
            <p>The WDC initative harvests structured information from the Common Crawl, which
                stands as the most extensive publicly accessible web corpus. The extracted data is
                then made available for public download, aimed at assisting both researchers and
                enterprises in leveraging the vast repository of data present on the Web. The <a href="https://webdatacommons.org/largescaleproductcorpus/index.html" target="_blank">WDC Product Matching Corpus</a>
                comprises over 26 million product offers collected from approximately 79,000 websites. This corpus was initially developed for the purpose
                of assessing product matching techniques, categorizing the offers into 16 million
                product clusters. Each cluster consolidates offers pertaining to the same product by employing product identifiers for organization, a feature that proves beneficial for
                our manual annotation of the WDC-PAVE dataset. Exploiting the cluster structure makes the resulting annotated dataset not only suitable form product attribute value extraction,
                but also for product matching. Besides product titles and descriptions and product category annotations, about 17% of the corpus features the specification table content of
                the product's website as a string, as well as key-value pairs that are extracted from
                these tables using a table detection heuristic (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3308560.3316609"><cite>Primpeli et al. 2019</cite></a>). 
                These key-value pairs build the foundation for the WCD-PAVE dataset.  </p>

        <section id="data_selection">
            <h3>2.2 Data Preprocessing and Selection</h3>
            <p>In light of the noisy nature of web data, we perform a series of cleansing and filtering steps upon creating the dataset. 
                These measures are designed to streamline the annotation process to the greatest extent feasible. 
                Initially, product offers that are missing titles, descriptions, or key-value pairs from specification tables are excluded. In an effort to improve the cost-effectiveness of experiments and reduce the presence of noisy descriptions that are largely irrelevant for prodcut information, products whose descriptions exceed 1000 characters are also discarded. 
                Furthermore, HTML and language tags are stripped from the titles and descriptions. 
                We retain only product texts that are in English.</p>
            <p>As previously mentioned, the WDC Product Data Corpus organizes offers into clusters of products. In an effort to amass a wide array of unique attribute-value pairs 
                before proceeding with annotation, the key-value pairs from all offers within a cluster are consolidated. This enrichment process guarantees that attribute-values from all 
                retailers are attributed to every individual product offer, ensuring the greatest coverage of attribute-values for each offer. 
                In this context, product offers that belong to clusters with fewer than two domains or have a cluster size smaller than two are excluded from the dataset. 
                This exclusion strategy is aimed at ensuring a diverse array of sources, thereby enhancing the richness of product information. 
                The selection of the most appropriate categories for the WDC-AVE dataset involved ranking product offer categories by their average cluster sizes and conducting a manual review of the product texts to exclude noisy categories. 
                Consequently, the categories chosen were "Computers And Accessories", "Jewelry", "Grocery And Gourmet Food", "Office Products", and "Home And Garden," as these were deemed to offer the most accurate and relevant data.</p>
            <p>To streamline the dataset, we embarked on a process to analyze and refine its attributes. Initially, we identified a wide range of attributes across all 
                    categories, with each category having between 190 to 1475 unique attributes. We noted that some attributes were functionally 
                    equivalent despite different names, and others were irrelevant noise. To manage this diversity and avoid disproportionate attribute 
                    loss across categories, we implemented a tailored filtering process. This process adjusted the attribute removal thresholds by category 
                    based on their unique distributions, effectively reducing the attribute count to 41-169 per category. Subsequently, we manually merged 
                    equivalent attributes and eliminated any left noise attributes.</p>
            <p>To accurately link product titles and descriptions with their respective attributes and values, 
                we employed a string-matching method. This process identified attribute-value pairs directly mentioned in 
                the product text as 'positive pairs'. Conversely, pairs not found in the title or description were classified as 
                'negative pairs'. To reduce the chance of overlooking valid matches due to textual variations, we adjusted for different 
                phrasings of the same attribute-value pairs. This step was crucial for refining our focus to attributes most likely to be 
                relevant, which we then annotated manually. Specifically, we eliminated attributes from manual review if they had a matching
                 rate of less than 10% with the product text, streamlining the annotation process. </p>
                
            <p>In sampling the product offers, our methodology advanced beyond mere random selection by leveraging a targeted approach that accounted for both the main category and the 'Product Type' attribute, which is consistent across all five categories. By initially selecting a maximum of one offer from each product cluster to form a candidate offer pool, we effectively eliminated duplicates and preserved a wide range of attribute-value data. This process, followed by stratified sampling based on category and product type, significantly increased the diversity of product types in our dataset. Compared to random category-based sampling, our 
                approach markedly improved the dataset's overall quality and relevance for attribute-value extraction tasks, ensuring a more varied representation 
                of product types.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="annotation_process">
            <h3>2.3 Annotation Process</h3>
            <p>To ensure precise and comprehensive annotation, a multi-step process was utilized. Initially, offers from each product category were standardized by supplementing missing category-specific attributes, making sure that every product offer is supplied with all applicable attributes from its respective category. String matching against product titles and descriptions using the existing category attribute-values facilitated the identification of potential values for these attributes. </p>
            <p>Detailed guidelines were established to maintain consistency and quality in identifying attribute-value pairs. This included prioritizing complete spans over incomplete ones and assigning a single attribute type to each span, with special attention to prevent overlap among attribute values or with unrelated text segments. Efforts were made to annotate values concisely, including all relevant variations and expressions of values.</p>
            <p>A custom annotation tool was developed to streamline the process, facilitating validation of attribute values with user input. This tool employed heuristic techniques to enhance annotation precision and efficiency, even for non-domain experts. It provided attribute names, suggested values (collected from all product offers of the respecitve cluster), and context through example values and descriptions, aiding in the accurate categorization of data. The tool's design allowed for iterative user validation, ensuring the accuracy of recorded values.</p>
            <p>The process involved a second round of annotation to add attributes that were previously missing in the data, culminating in the annotation of 24,582 attribute-value pairs across 1420 products. This extensive effort also included online research to verify uncertain items, ensuring the integrity of the dataset's annotations.</p>

            <h3>2.4 Dataset Structure</h3>
            <p>The dataset is structured in the JSON Lines (JSONL) format, supplementing each product with a comprehensive set of attributes and values. This format enables the representation of complex data about products in a structured and accessible manner. Each entry in the dataset corresponds to a single product offer and includes several key fields:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>id:</strong> The unique WDC product offer identifier.</li>
                <li><strong>cluster_id:</strong> The WDC cluster identifier that groups offers referring to the same product.</li>
                <li><strong>category:</strong> The product category.</li>
                <li><strong>input_title:</strong> The product title as it appears on the source website.</li>
                <li><strong>input_description:</strong> The product description as it appears on the source website.</li>
                <li><strong>target_scores:</strong> A structured object detailing the annotated attributes of the product. Each attribute is associated with:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>pid:</b> An array indicating whether the attribute value appears in the title (0) and/or description (1).</li>

        <h3>2.5 Dataset Statistics</h3>
        <p>Table 1 provides an overview of the WDC-PAVE dataset, detailing that it consists of 1,420 unique product 
            listings spread over five distinct categories, featuring a collective total of 70 different attributes across 
            these sectors. Table 2 further delineates the dataset by category: "Computers and Accessories" are described by 
            15 unique attributes, "Home And Garden" by 20, "Office Products" by 18, "Grocery And Gourmet Food" by 8, and "Jewelry" 
            by 9. On average, each product has 6.51 attribute values correctly matched to its title or description. This average match 
            rate ranges from a low of 5.18 in "Jewelry" to a high of 7.52 in "Home And Garden.
            Moreover, the dataset exhibits several critical characteristics vital for product attribute value extraction tasks. 
            Notably, the dataset features an average of 8.91 negative pairs per product, highlighting the challenge of distinguishing between 
            relevant and irrelevant attribute values. The dataset's richness is also evident in the average number 
            of unique values per attribute, recorded at 70.43, with a median of 41 and a maximum of 416 unique values for 
            a single attribute, pointing to a wide variance in attribute specificity and the potential for complex attribute-value 
            relationships. Table 3 summarizes the number of unique values and the share of negative pairs per attribute in further detail.</p>
