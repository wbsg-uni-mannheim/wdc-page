<h2 id="about">1. About the WDC Web Table Corpora</h2>
<p>
The Web contains vast amounts of HTML tables. Most of these tables are used for layout purposes, but a small subset of the tables is relational, meaning that they contain structured data describing a set of entities. The Web Data Commons project extracts relational Web tables from the  <a href="http://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a>, the largest and most up-to-data Web corpus that is currently available to the public. The resulting Web table corpora are provided for public download. In addition, we calculate statistics about the structure and content of the tables.
</p>
<p>
Up till now, we have extracted two Web table corpora from the Common Crawl:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#results-2015">WDC Web Table Corpus 2015</a> 
    <ul>
      <li>extracted from the July 2015 Common Crawl containing 1.78 billion HTML pages originating from 15 million pay-level domains.</li>
      <li>the corpus contains <strong>233 million Web tables</strong> which are classified into the categories: relational,  entity,  and matrix.
      <li>the corpus contains metadata for each table including table orientation, header rows, key columns</li>
      <li>the corpus contains context information for the table such as the title of the HTML page, the text before and after the table, and timestamps from the page.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#results-2012">WDC Web Table Corpus 2012 </a>
    <ul>
      
      <li>extracted from the 2012 Common Crawl containing 3.5 billion HTML pages originating from 40 million pay-level domains.</li>
      <li>the corpus contains <strong>147 million  Web tables</strong>.</li>
      <li>the corpus does not contain metadata about table orientation, header rows, and key columns, as well as no table context data.
    </p>

<h2 id="about">2. Application Potential of Web Tables</h2>

<p>This Section gives an overview of existing research on  employing Web tables within various application domains as well as empirical studies about the amount and content of relational tables on the Web. The first step towards understanding Web tables is to detect relational tables [<a href="#Wang2002">Wang2002</a>]. Initial studies by Cafarella et al. [<a href="#Cafarella2008">Cafarella2008</a>] showed that out of 14 billion HTML tables in the Google crawl, 154 million tables contained relational data (1.1%). In [<a href="#Crestan2011">Crestan2011</a>], the authors provide a fine-grained classification of the different types of HTML tables that are found on the Web based on the Bing Web crawl.  [<a href="#Hassanzadeh2015">Hassanzadeh2015</a>] identifies the topical distribution of Web table data by matching tables to different cross-domain knowledge bases.</p>
<p>Recently, a body of interesting research has developed around exploiting relational Web tables for the following applications:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Data Search</b>: A user that is in need for some data is likely to find a table containing the desired data somewhere on the Web. [<a href="#Cafarella2009">Cafarella2009</a>], [<a href="#Venetis2011">Venetis2011</a>], and [<a href="#Pimplikar2012">Pimplikar2012</a>] propose methods for finding matching tables given a set of keywords describing the information need. An example of a table search service is <a href="http://research.google.com/tables">Google Table Search</a> which allows users to search for Web tables as well as public Google Fusion Tables [<a href="#Balakrishnan2015">Balakrishnan2015</a>]. [<a href="#Tam2015">Tam2015</a>] formalize the requirements for Web table search and present algorithms to solve the connected problems.

<li><b>Table Extension</b>: [<a href="#Cafarella2009">Cafarella2009</a>], [<a href="#Yakout2012">Yakout2012</a>], [<a href="#Bhagavatula2013">Bhagavatula2013</a>], [<a href="#DasSarma2012">DasSarma2012</a>],  [<a href="#Bizer2014">Bizer2014</a>], [<a href="#Lehmberg2014">Lehmberg2014</a>] and [<a href="#Lehmberg2015">Lehmberg2015</a>] propose methods for extending a local table with additional columns based on the corpus of tables that are published on the Web. A user having a local table describing countries could for instance use these methods to have columns containing the population, area total, and the capital of each country added to his table.</li>

<li><b>Knowledge Base Construction</b>: The data contained in Web tables can also be used to construct or extend general-purpose knowledge bases such as DBpedia, Freebase or YAGO. [<a href="#Zhang2013">Zhang2013</a>] propose a method for extending the DBpedia knowledge base with data from Web tables. [<a href="#Sekhavat2014">Sekhavat2014</a>] introduce a probabilistic approach for extending YAGO by exploiting natural language patterns.   [<a href="#Wang2012">Wang2012</a>] propose a method for building a comprehensive knowledge base using linguistic patters to extract a probabilistic taxonomy of classes and entities from Web texts and add facts about the attributes of the entities using Web tables afterwards. Biperpedia [<a href="Gupta2014">Gupta2014</a>] has been created by exploiting query stream and applying the learnt extractors. The Knowledge Vault [<a href="#Dong2014">Dong2014</a>] extends  Freebase using Web tables data amongst other types of Web data. An overview of knowledge base construction approaches using Web sources is given by Weikum and Theobald [<a href="Weikum2010">Weikum2010</a>].</li>

<li><b>Table Matching</b>: For most applications, the matching of Web tables plays an important role and is discussed in different works. [<a href="#Limaye2010">Limaye2010</a>], [<a href="#Mulwad2010">Mulwad2010</a>] propose frameworks to annotate the Web tables with entities, properties and types from knowledge bases. [<a href="#Ritze2015">Ritze2015</a>] introduce an simultaneous schema- and instance matching approach to annotate rows with entities, columns with properties and tables with types. Other methods further exploit the context [<a href="#Wang2015">Wang2015</a>], [<a href="#Braunschweig2015">Braunschweig2015</a>] as well as timestamps [<a href="#Zhang2013">Zhang2013</a>]. In addition to fully automatic approaches, crowdsourcing can support the matching process [<a href="#Fan2014">Fan2014</a>], [<a href="#Chu2015">Chu2015</a>].</li>

<li><b>NLP Tasks</b>: The table corpus could also be useful for various natural language processing tasks as the things that appear in the same column are often closely related to each other, which for example can be exploited for disambiguation.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="results-2015">3. WDC Web Table Corpus 2015</h2>
<p> This Section describes the methodology that was used to extract the July 2015 Web Table Corpus  and links to pages containing detailed statistics about the corpus as well as download instructions. The July 2015 Common Crawl corpus contains 1.78 billion HTML documents from over 15 million pay-level domains.</p>

<p>We employ the <a href="https://wwwdb.inf.tu-dresden.de/misc/dwtc/">DWTC framework</a> from the Database Technology Group at the University of Dresden to extract HTML tables  from the crawl and to distinguish between different types of Web tables, e.g. relational and layout tables. The table type assignment works in two steps: filtering and classification. </p>
<p>First, the framework <strong>filters</strong> out all HTML tables that are not innermost tables, i.e., that contain tables in their cells, and all tables contain less than 2 columns or 3 rows. Further, the framework looks at other criteria such as sparseness of the table, average attribute size, number of links etc. This step discards most of the HTML tables that we consider as non-genuine. Altogether, we parsed 1.78 billion HTML pages from the Common Crawl July 2015 Web corpus. In these pages we found a total of 10.24 billion innermost tables, i.e., an average of 5.75 innermost tables per page.
After the filtering step, 233 million tables remain. A content-based deduplication is not performed. </p>
<p>
Second, the framework parses the tables and <strong>classifies</strong> them as <i>Relational</i>, <i>Entity</i>, <i>Matrix</i> and <i>Layout</i>. Figure 1 shows examples of the first three table types. Relational tables (1.a) describe a set of similar entities (here: lakes) with one or more attributes (area). The name of the entity, also called key, is contained in the table. In contrast, entity tables (1.b) only describe one entity with one or more attributes. The name of this entity is usually not contained in the table but may be found in the table context. A common example of entity tables are tables containing product details (but not the product name) on shopping websites. The third table type matrix (1.c) is most often used for results of statistical evaluations.</p>
<figure>

    <p>Fig. 1: Examples of the three table types extracted from the English Wikipedia [<a href="Braunschweig2015a">Braunschweig2015a</a>]</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure> 
<p> The classification into the different types uses a mixture of global and local features, see [<a href="#Braunschweig2015a">Braunschweig2015a</a>] for more details. The global features include average and standard deviation of the column and row count as well as the average cell length. Additionally, it computes content ratios (image, alphabetical and digit) and cumulative content type length consistencies of the rows and columns [<a href="#Crestan2011">Crestan2011</a>, <a href="#Wang2002">Wang2002</a>]. The local features are local average length, local length variance and local content ratio of cells.
Table 1 shows the distribution of the resulting table types. Altogether, 90,266,223 tables were classified as relational tables (0.9%) which is in line with the results by Cafarella et al. [<a href="#Cafarella2008">Cafarella2008</a>] (1.1%) and the results of our <a href="#results-2012">previous extraction</a> (1.3%).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
On top of the DWTC framework, we implemented methods to determine the <b>orientation of a table</b>, i.e., <i>Horizontal</i> or <i>Vertical</i>,  the<b> header row,</b> the <b>key column </b>(if existant), as well as methods to extract <strong>context data</strong> from the page content around the Web table. </p>
<p>
<b>Table Orientation</b>: 
In horizontal tables, the attributes are represented in the columns while in vertical tables the attributes are described in rows, e.g. as shown in Figure 1a. The determination of the table orientation bases on the idea that for horizontal tables, the cells in one column have a similar length because they belong to the same attribute. In contrast, the opposite holds for vertical tables where cells in one row typically have a similar length. We determine the orientation of a table by computing the standard deviation (STD) of the cell length for each row and column. If the average STD for columns is smaller than the average STD for rows, we define the table as horizontal and otherwise as vertical.
</p>
<p>
<b>Header Row Detection</b>: 
For the description of our header row detection, we always assume to have a horizontal table but of course can also be applied on vertical tables. We define a header row as the row containing the attribute names, e.g. the first row in Figure 1a with the attribute names 'Lake' and 'Area'. Our header detection bases on the idea that a header row shows a different characteristic than the following rows. Therefore, we analyze the rows by building a content pattern for each cell in a row. A cell content pattern is a strining together of the following classes: alphabetical (A), digit (D), punctuation (P) and special character (S). For example, a cell with the content "area" has the content pattern "AAAA" while a cell with the content "5.69m" is described by the pattern "DPDDA". Based on these patterns, we can determine the different characteristics of rows and thus we can conclude which row contains the names of the attributes and is in turn considered as the header row.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Key Column Detection</b>: 
Similar to the header row detection, we assume to have a horizontal table for the key column detection. The key column of a table is said to be the column which contains the names of the entities, e.g. the second column of the table in Figure 1a with the attribute name 'Lake'. Our key column detection bases on the idea that a key column contains a certain amount of unique cell values because it contains the names of different entities. Thus, our main assumption is that the key column covers a high amount of unique cell values. Besides the requirement of having at least 50% unique values, it must be a column mainly consisting of string values and have an average length greater than 3.5 and lower than 200.</p> 
<p><strong>Context Data:</strong> In order to understand the content of Web tables [<a href="#Yakout2012">Yakout2012</a>] as well as for determining the timeliness of the content, it is beneficial to know the text that appears on the HTML page around the Web table. We thus also extract context related data from the HTML page:   200 words before as well as after the table, the last modified date in the HTTP header, and sentences in surrounding paragraphs containing timestamps.</p>

<p>We ran the table extraction on Amazon EC2 using 100 AWS c1.xlarge machines, the extraction and table classification together took around 25 hours, which cost around 250 USD. The table below summarizes key figures of the extraction run:</p>

<h2 id="results-2012">4. WDC Web Table Corpus 2012</h2>
<p> This Section describes the methodology that was applied to extract the August 2012 Web Table Corpus from the Common Crawl Web corpus and links to pages containing detailed statistics about the corpus as well as download instructions.  The 2012 Common Crawl corpus contains 3.5 billion HTML documents which originate from over 40 million pay-level domains.</p>

[<a href="#Cafarella2008">Cafarella2008</a>], [<a href="#Crestan2011">Crestan2011</a>], and [<a href="#Wang2002">Wang2002</a>] propose classification methods for distinguishing between relational Web tables and other HTML tables. Based on the features proposed in these papers, we implemented a classifier for detecting relational Web tables. The classifier works in two steps. First, it filters out all HTML tables that are not innermost tables, i.e., that contain tables in their cells, and that contain less than 5 cells or 3 rows. This step discards already around 90% of all HTML tables. Second, we parse the remaining tables and classify them as <i>relational</i> or <i>not relational</i> using a mixture of layout and content features. The layout features include the average and the standard deviation of the column count, row count and cell length. Additionally we compute the length consistency of the rows and columns. Content features are the percentages of link, form, image, empty, digit, and text cells. We also compute the content type consistency for rows and columns. 
</p>
<p>Altogether, we parsed 3,301,089,681 HTML pages from the Common Crawl 2012 Web corpus. In these pages we found a total of 11,245,583,889 innermost tables, i.e., an average of 3.4 innermost tables per page. Out of these tables, 147,636,113 were classified as relational tables (1.3%). The tables originate from 101,177,544 different pages. A further classification into entity tables has not been performed.</p>
<p>In order not to miss relational tables, we tuned our classifier for recall at the cost of precision. An evaluation on a test set of several thousand tables showed that only around 60% of the tables classified as relational are actually relational tables (compared to the 80% precision reported in [<a href="#Cafarella2008">Cafarella2008</a>]). </p>

<p>We ran the table extraction on Amazon EC2 using 100 AWS c1.xlarge machines, which ran an adapted version of the extraction framework that we also used to extract the <a href="http://webdatacommons.org/">WebDataCommons RDFa, Microdata, and Microformat Data Set</a> from the Common Crawl. The extraction and table classification together took around 1,500 machine hours, which cost around 150 USD.  The table below summarizes key figures of the extraction run:</p>
